## Target Users

- HYROX athletes
- Coaches
- Fitness communities

## Business Goals

- High reliability
- Accurate ranking calculations
- Scalable data architecture
- Fast feature delivery

## Product Principles

1. Brutal Honesty Over Comfort  
The system must prioritize truth over motivation. Guidance may be uncomfortable, but always aligned with performance.

2. Alignment Over Volume  
Training quality is defined by alignment with the competition goal, not by quantity of workouts.

3. Amateur-Centered Design  
The product is designed for disciplined amateurs with limited time, not for professional athletes.

4. Context Before Data  
Numbers only matter when interpreted within the athlete’s context, calendar and objectives.

5. Education Over Prescription  
The system teaches the athlete how to think, not only what to do.

6. Focus Over Variety  
The system discourages activities that do not contribute to the defined HYROX objective.

7. Reality-Based Performance  
Recommendations respect time availability, recovery and real-life constraints.
