# HYROX Performance Tracker – Engineering Management Project

This repository represents a fictional SaaS product created to practice Engineering Management concepts.

The goal is not to build the system, but to design, manage and reason about engineering decisions such as:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Technical debt
- Architecture evolution
- Risk management
- Product impact

The product is inspired by HYROX competitions and focuses on tracking athlete performance, rankings and progression.

This project is used purely for learning and leadership development purposes.

## Product Statement

This is not a training app.  
It is a decision alignment system for disciplined amateurs preparing for HYROX.
